## Project Overview

![Multitool whole]({{ "/assets/images/Entire_wrench.png" | relative_url }}){: style="width: 550px"}

This project focused on designing a compact, space efficient multitool wrench intended to reduce the number of individual tools required for common mechanical tasks. The tool integrates multiple wrench geometries into a single modular body while maintaining usability, structural integrity, and manufacturability.

The entire tool was modeled parametrically in Autodesk Fusion 360, allowing key dimensions such as jaw width, handle length, and thickness to be rapidly modified to generate different tool variants. The design emphasizes both functional ergonomics and efficient material usage, making it suitable for both consumer and workshop environments.

## Engineering & Design Highlights

- Parametric wrench jaw profiles for rapid resizing and tool family generation  
- Integrated multi size hex and open end geometries within a single compact body  
- Structural thickness optimization for strength while minimizing mass  
- Ergonomic handle geometry for improved grip and torque application  
- Modular design logic enabling scalable tool configurations  
- Manufacturing oriented geometry suitable for CNC machining or metal additive manufacturing  

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates mechanical design thinking, tolerance aware modeling, and manufacturability focused CAD workflows. It highlights the balance between strength, usability, and material efficiency that defines effective product engineering.

The multitool wrench reflects real world engineering constraints and illustrates how parametric modeling can be leveraged to create adaptable, production ready mechanical systems rather than single use CAD parts.
