This project is a fully parametric, dimension accurate LEGO style minifigure modeled entirely in Autodesk Fusion 360. The objective was to replicate the geometry, articulation, and assembly logic of an injection molded consumer product while integrating custom Cornell Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering branding.

The model was created as a true multi-body assembly, with each component—head, torso, arms, hands, hips, and legs—designed as its own manufacturable solid. All major dimensions are parametrically constrained, enabling rapid scaling, pose variation, and design iteration without rebuilding geometry.

## Engineering & Design Highlights

- Parametric joint interfaces that replicate real LEGO articulation geometry  
- Multi-body assembly structure mirroring real molded plastic manufacturing logic  
- Fillet blending and surface continuity for production grade plastic appearance  
- Custom decal mapping for Cornell MAE branding and crest placement  
- Physically based materials and lighting for product quality rendering  
- Constraint driven proportions for consistent part fit and motion  

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to design real world consumer products rather than static CAD geometry. It reflects clean parametric workflows, articulation based mechanical design, and surface modeling practices commonly used in plastics manufacturing, product design, and mechanical prototyping.

The result is a fully articulated, brand customized minifigure that functions as both a technical CAD study and a professional product visualization asset.
