#### Projects
**Multitool Design Project — Cornell Mechanical Design**  
Designed and prototyped a compact multitool aimed at maximizing drawer space efficiency.  
  - Led CAD modeling in Fusion 360 and iterative design refinement  
  - Utilized 3D printing to validate fit, ergonomics, and functional performance  
  - Contributed to manufacturability decisions and design reviews  
  - Presented final prototype and design rationale to course staff
 
**Instrumented Torque Wrench Design Project — Cornell MAE 3270**
Designed and analyzed a 3/8-inch drive instrumented torque wrench rated for ±600 in-lbf, integrating hand calculations, materials selection, CAD, and FEM verification.
  - Performed analytical stress, strain, fatigue, and fracture calculations to size geometry and evaluate candidate materials
  - Developed a MATLAB/Python script to iterate design parameters and meet strength, crack-growth, and fatigue safety factors
  - Created the CAD model in Fusion 360 and refined the design to improve strain-gauge sensitivity and stress distribution
  - Imported the model into ANSYS, conducted FEM analysis with mesh refinement, and compared results to hand-calculation predictions
