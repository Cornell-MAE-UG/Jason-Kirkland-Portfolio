## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Jason_aboutme.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University  and a student-athlete on the Division 1 football team. My academic interests include automotive, aerospace, robotics, product design, energy systems, and advanced manufacturing. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through hands-on engineering and innovation.

Balancing academics with athletics has taught me discipline, leadership, and time management—skills that I bring to every team I’m part of. In high school, I worked jobs in customer service and safety, developing strong communication and responsibility. 

My years of Boy Scouts experience taught me leadership, teamwork, organization, and service skills that will carry me through life. I earned the Life Count rank, which is the 2nd highest rank in Boy Scouts. 

I’m currently exploring internship and research opportunities to apply my growing technical knowledge. I’m especially interested in industries like automotive, aerospace, robotics, and sustainability.
